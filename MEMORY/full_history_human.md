## 2026-05-14 — Issue #1: pin the shared substrate
**Duration:** ~50 min · **Branch:** `session/2026-05-14-1435-issue-01`

- Committed five hand-authored Markdown technical articles to
  `data/corpus/` (MIT) covering HNSW, RRF, Anthropic prompt caching,
  evaluation-harness design, and async LLM pipelines. Multi-paragraph,
  structurally varied — chunking strategies will visibly differentiate.
- Committed 12 verbatim-snippet queries to `data/queries.jsonl`. Each
  query's `expected_snippet` is literal text from its `expected_doc`,
  and a test (`test_each_expected_snippet_is_verbatim_in_its_document`)
  is the gate that prevents the corpus and queries from drifting apart.
- Pinned `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` as
  `CANONICAL_EMBEDDING_MODEL`. Ships an `Embedder` Protocol with a
  dep-free `HashEmbedder` (matched to 384-d so strategies tested under
  it transfer to the real embedder) and a `MiniLMEmbedder` adapter
  behind the `[sbert]` optional extra.
- `docs/setup.md` documents the full substrate + the change protocol
  (any corpus/query/model edit invalidates downstream numbers and
  requires a deliberate revisit of D-002).
- 18 tests, 92% coverage on `chunking_lab/`. Real CI (ruff +
  pytest matrix py3.11/3.12).
- Two decisions recorded: D-002 (the substrate pin itself, the issue's
  explicit acceptance criterion) and D-003 (real embedder behind the
  optional extra, dep-free reference for CI).

**Why this work, this session:** Issue #1 is the gate for #2 and #3 —
without a pinned substrate, the strategy comparison numbers in #3
aren't reproducible.

**Open questions / blockers:** None.

**Next session:** Issue #2 — the five chunking strategies, each
exposing `chunk(text, **opts) -> list[Chunk]` against this substrate.
